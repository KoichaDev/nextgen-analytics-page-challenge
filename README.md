## Chart.js library Issue

I used the [React Chart.js](https://github.com/jerairrest/react-chartjs-2). This library isn't officially supported from the [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), but rather from someone else, and hasn't been updated for 2 years.

I faced an issue where I can't add the text center in the middle of the doughnut graph properly, also creating the legend accordingly after the Challenge screenshot.

What I had to do is just make an ***p-elemen*t** and positioning it around to mimic to look like the challenge screenshot. 

***Note***: This is not a solution to solve X, but rather Y.
